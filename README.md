# Description
A Database Management System (DBMS) for a fuel distribution company developed using SQL.

# Note
SQL includes CREATE and INSERT statements as well as some SELECT queries.

# Note
I created a branch called loayhalawani and hadikaraki, when you push the code using git push, push to your branch and when we make sure the code is correct we put to the main branch

Good idea Hadi 👍
